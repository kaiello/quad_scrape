- 
- Problem Statement: Warfighters need potable water within 72 hours for survival, but water transport is costly, inefficient, and vulnerable in contested environments. ROWPU systems are predictable, maintenance-heavy, and require frequent filter changes. WaterCube ® overcomes these challenges, supporting sustained operations in forward areas under ACE, MEU, and MDO concepts where mobility and operational freedom are critical.
- 
- Project Description:  Genesis Systems' WaterCube ® (Renewable Water from Air) technology, developed through partnerships with AFRL and Army Research Labs under five SBIR contracts over 6 years, is designed for military use.
- 
- Benefit to Warfighter: Provides clean, reliable water at the point of need, eliminating water resupply, reducing unit footprint, and removing chlorine treatment. WaterCube ® enhances mobility and operational flexibility, ending reliance on external sustainment.

Schedule:

- Additional Facility Standup – Production ramp-up	Q2 FY26
- Initial delivery of 39 WaterCube ® systems	Q4 FY26
- Achieve full rate production Capability	Q1 FY27
- Mid Point Production – 292 WaterCube ® systems delivered	Q4 FY28
- Remaining of 581  WaterCube ® systems delivered	Q4 FY29
