## Technology Description / Product:

- HM 2 P is a scalable maritime transportation concept with advanced hydro-ski technology resulting in excellent speed, efficiency, maneuverability & sea-state operability. The concept is a solution to the elusive problem of high-water speed during elevated sea states.
- •
- Starting TRL:  6 Ending TRL: 7 to 8
## Experiment Design:

The  HM 2 P concept is a versatile, high-performance maritime platform with operability through sea-state 3. The speed and efficiency of the platform will benefit numerous applications with reduced time to target, fuel savings, expanded zone of influence and mission duration.

## Funding (Two-year FY24 RDT&E funding for duration of project (12-24mos)

## Key Deliverables:

- Develop, build, test internally (1) small and (1) medium HM 2 P watercraft for instrumentation, testing and refinement of designs. Then build and deliver five (5) units of each of the small + medium watercraft for test, data collection, analysis and demonstration in a TRL 7 'operational environment.'
## Project Risks & Opportunities:

- Risks: New Technology Acceptance, Funding
- Revised: MMDDYYYY · Opportunities: Low cost, multi-mission flexibility, energy efficient, maneuver/swarm
