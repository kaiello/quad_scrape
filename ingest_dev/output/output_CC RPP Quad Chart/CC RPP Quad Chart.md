1

(U) Key Partners / Participants

- Project Lead (PL) Agency:  Missile Defense Agency
- Gov’t Contributors:  USINDOPACOM
- Transition Partners: USINDOPACOM, RCCTO, U.S. Army Futures Command
- Other Partners: GA-EMS, BAE, NSWC Dahlgren, TBE, APL, LLNL, more forthcoming 

- (U) Expected Operational Value
- Greater maneuverability at greater ranges than other HVP systems
- Greater command agility allowing variation in defensive system selection
- Allows greater performance symmetry of defensive missile systems
- Capable of massing fires on threats from multiple locations	

- (U) Technology Description / Product
- LB-EMRG fires the Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) to Mach 7+ and 100 NM
- Accomplished 456 test flights and 23 successful intercepts
- Accomplished 20 rounds per min 
- Hypervelocity Gun Weapon System (HGWS) is significantly outperformed by EMRG in flight tests
- Mach 4+ / range: 17-41 nm (depending on gun)
- Starting TRL:	7	Ending TRL:  9

(U) Key Deliverables

- Upgraded System (from NSF Dahlgren)
- System integration with IBCS and IFCN
- Operational Prototype
- Capability Delivery 
- Capable of massing fires on threats from multiple locations
- 32MJ LB-EMRG w/initial capability of 20 rounds/min 
- Enhanced demonstration to validate CONOPS for new deterrent system 
- AUKUS/Japan/ROK opportunity to co-develop tactical system, cross-AOR supply chain; Quad-Lateral effort to mitigate contested logistics threat by extreme depth of newly layered defense

- (U) Transition Strategy
- MDA matures TRL to transition path for multiple stakeholders
- USAF to enhance the GLADIATR program for enhanced based defense
- U.S. Army: IAMD, Shoreline Defense, CUAS (types 1-3), Sub/Supersonic cruise missile defense, Large caliber rocket defense
