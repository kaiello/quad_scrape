## Automatic Landing Zone (Auto-LZ)

## Process:

- Sources Image Classification products
-  Water, Trees/vegetation
-  Buildings, Terrain
-  Vertical obstructions
-  Weather
- Process data layers and void locations based on Vehicle Constraints
-  Surface will not allow for recovery
-  Terrain slope exceeds vehicle capabilities
-  Ground winds exceed vehicle capabilities
- Reduce available Drop Zones or Landing Zones area based vertical obstructions and Vehicle Performance
-  Ingress/Egress glide slope
-  System accuracy
-  (O) Predicted landing direction
- Result: Map & database presenting possible Drop Zones & Landing Zones.
