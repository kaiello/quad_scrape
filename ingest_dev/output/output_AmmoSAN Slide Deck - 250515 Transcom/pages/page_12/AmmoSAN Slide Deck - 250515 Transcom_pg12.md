## Sustainment Support Network for Autonomous Aerial Resupply Vehicles (SNAARV)

PROBLEM/ISSUE :  Current aerial resupply infrastructure lacks the ability to source, process, and distribute flight data to vehicles for mission planning and execution. Data sourcing and distribution rely on a network of highly trained and expensive Field Service Representatives to manually download data on a per mission basis from multiple independent sources, process and synthesis with additional data on a unique mission planning computer and prepared for vehicle transfer. Additionally,  the next generation of guided aerial  resupply vehicles are targeting significantly longer ranges and flight times which will  require much more information prior to and potentially during flight.

## Applicable Guidance/Authority:

- USTRANSCOM FY25 Challenge Ready Now and in the Future - Rapid Distribution Technologies focus area as it autonomously facilitates end-to-end flow of military equipment and cargo.
- USTRANSCOM FY25 Challenge Create Decision Advantage - Big Data focus area given that the infrastructure to be developed will enable data discovery and predictive/prescriptive analytics. List the gaps/challenges/documentation for requirement traceability
- The Joint Concept for Contested Logistics (JCCL) is a Joint Warfighting Concept which is derived from the National Defense Strategy and outlines Resilient Logistics as 'the ability to project and protect access to critical joint logistics material, assets, infrastructure, …, and networks from the point of origin to the point of need…' related to sustainment for distributed operations.
RATIONALE: This proposal will leverage existing government owned, disconnected servers and applications to develop an integrated solution that automatically sources, processes, synthesizes, and distributes data to the following autonomous aerial resupply vehicles

PROGRAM OF RECORD: US Army PM FSS JPADS 2klb Program of Record with strong linkages are to the USAF CAT Program of Record and the Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution for integration with currently available systems.

VALUE ADDED/ROI: Provide a streamlined, automated pipeline of mission critical data enabling faster response times to real-time logistics needs, reducing timeconsuming manual decision making and processes.
