Data sourcing and distribution rely on a network of highly trained and expensive Field Service Representatives to manually download data on a per mission basis from multiple independent sources, process and synthesis with additional data on a unique mission planning computer and prepared for vehicle transfer. Additionally,  the next generation of guided aerial  resupply vehicles are targeting significantly longer ranges and flight times which will  require much more information prior to and potentially during flight.", "type": "UncategorizedText"}, {"element_id": "c255e8ca-c809-4e05-9d3f-38a7ee1cbf94", "metadata": {"page_number": 12}, "text": "Applicable Guidance/Authority:", "type": "Title"}, {"element_id": "d3f21bba-fb8a-4e62-b77f-112b03306501", "metadata": {"page_number": 12}, "text": "USTRANSCOM FY25 Challenge Ready Now and in the Future - Rapid Distribution Technologies focus area as it autonomously facilitates end-to-end flow of military equipment and cargo.", "type": "ListItem"}, {"element_id": "dbc737af-7395-4f6d-b961-bea60eec8253", "metadata": {"page_number": 12}, "text": "USTRANSCOM FY25 Challenge Create Decision Advantage - Big Data focus area given that the infrastructure to be developed will enable data discovery and predictive/prescriptive analytics.
