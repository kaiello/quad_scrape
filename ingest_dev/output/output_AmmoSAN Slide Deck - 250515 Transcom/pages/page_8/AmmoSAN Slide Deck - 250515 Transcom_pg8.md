## (U) PROJECTS, TRANSITIONS, & TEAMING

## Project Description

- 1.Armament and Ammunition Data Driven Expeditionary Resupply (AADDER) : DEVCOM AC proof of concept/benchtop demonstration showing viability of Class-V consumption driven decision making for resupply, advanced manufacturing, and predicted logistics.
- 2.Small Unit Resupply (SUR) Information Exchange : Digitalizes the resupply request and pre-flight coordination across multiple sustainment personnel/organizations.
- 3.SUR Supply/Consumption Initiated Resupply : Automatically initiates a resupply based on manual reporting, real-time monitoring, and all-echelon of supply level data aggregation.
- 4.SUR Decision Dominance : Accelerates reply planning thought automation.  Automates resupply vehicle selection based on vehicle availability and mission suitability, monitors and adapts to failure during mission execution, and allows caching of supply in route at time of need.
- 5.Automatic Landing Zone (Auto-LZ) : Automates Drop Zone/Landing Zone selection based on vehicle performance models and digital environment around point of need.
- 6.Preflight Resupply Data Processing and Distribution : Automates resupply mission data sourcing, aggregation, processing, and distribution for autonomous resupply systems.
- 7.PITSTOP - Provide ability to report supplies manually, aggregate the data with consumption sensors up the chain of command, facilitate field level cross leveling, and provide a field level map-based supply database that links up CL-III consumers and providers.
- 8.AmmoSAN : Integration effort of various disparate projects into a reliable and operationally effective capability.
- 1.ARC M4 & M-270 : On weapon sensor detecting consumption.
- 2.TAMMS : At-echelon perspective of ammunition posture across multiple formations, managing demand signal and response, linked into TDP.
- 3.CLESM : Provides 'digital twin' concept of weapon systems to feed armament system management and readiness. Discrete AI decision functionality across nested / linked operational nodes
