Additionally, Soldiers on the future battlefield will have access to a variety of resupply vehicles to choose from, which presents an impossible training burden to the force; since no single person/decision maker can be sufficiently trained on the performance of all resupply vehicles to determine which vehicle is best suited for a given mission. To overcome these challenges, commanders require an integrated and automated resupply planning and execution system that streamlines and accelerates the responsiveness of emergency aerial resupply by minimizing human in the loop decision making.
