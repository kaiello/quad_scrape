## Small Unit Resupply Decision Dominance (SUR-DD)

PROBLEM/ISSUE: The joint services currently lack the ability to support and manage largescale, high pace distributed operations in the Contested Logistics (CL) environment, where logistics systems and support personnel will need to be flexible and highly adaptive to a mobile and dynamic battlefield. Additionally, Soldiers on the future battlefield will have access to a variety of resupply vehicles to choose from, which presents an impossible training burden to the force; since no single person/decision maker can be sufficiently trained on the performance of all resupply vehicles to determine which vehicle is best suited for a given mission. To overcome these challenges, commanders require an integrated and automated resupply planning and execution system that streamlines and accelerates the responsiveness of emergency aerial resupply by minimizing human in the loop decision making.

## Applicable Guidance/Authority:

- Addresses numerous the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Joint Deployment & Distribution Enterprise (JDDE) Challenges Create Decision Advantage, specifically End-to-End Visibility and Integrated Common Intelligence Picture.
- Joint Concept for Contested Logistics (JCCL), document outlines the critical need to reduce/eliminate manual decision making within logistics/resupply process that supports the tactical edge.
- Interoperability with Small Unit Resupply (SUR) is a requirement the AbbreviatedCapability Development Document (A-CDD) for Autonomous Extended Range Aerial Delivery System (AERADS), desired Characteristic (DC) #3, Flight Planning and Mission Planning, and # 4, Autonomy and Mission Command.
- Identified as a need in Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier's Modernization Plan 2024, Project Polaris.
## RATIONALE: SUR-DD will accelerate and automate the resupply planning and execution through automation

- Automate vehicle selection based on (1) availability and (2) mission suitability.
- Automate mission tasking via interoperability with Mission Planning systems.
- Monitor & automatically adapt to failure during mission execution
- Resupply a moving target by monitoring the dismounted route, location, pace.
- Provide theater level situational awareness via a resupply Decision Dashboard.

## VALUE ADDED/ROI:

- Accelerate response-time & minimize support personnel through decision making.
- Increases efficiency through information exchange/portrayal.
- Increases the mission reliability via data driven decisions.
- Decreases the training needed for informed decision making.
