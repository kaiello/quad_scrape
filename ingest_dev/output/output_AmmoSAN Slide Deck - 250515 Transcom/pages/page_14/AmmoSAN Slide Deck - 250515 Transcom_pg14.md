## Automatic Landing Zone (Auto-LZ)

## PROBLEM/ISSUE :

Future Contested Logistics battlefields will require a various resupply vehicles and domains to counter the adversary's dynamic and evolving threats.  The availability and access to various resupply vehicles places an impossible training burden on the force, since no single person/office will be sufficiently trained on the performance specifications of each air vehicle and be capable to selecting the appropriate Landing Zone (LZ) or Drop Zone (DZ).

Automatic Landing Zone (Auto-LZ)

will aid in the selection of a LZ or DZ by presenting the user with a map-based course of action decision tool, at the point of need. The tool will identify and highlight potential LZs/DZs for use, given the performance specifications, limitations, and the flight model of the air vehicle.

## Applicable Guidance/Authority :

- Addresses the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Joint Deployment & Distribution Enterprise (JDDE) Challenges Create Decision Advantage Risk Assessment and Ready Now and in the Future - Delivery Technologies through automation of LZ/DZ selection and risk assessment, enablement of automatic emergency landing, and supporting of mission planning.
- Capability Development Document (CDD) for Autonomous Aerial Distribution, 30 April 2020, documents required system attributes for autonomous resupply vehicles of the future. This document includes Key System Attributes (KSA) such as Emergency Landing capability while in route  and the ability to conduct autonomous landing in a cleared area.
- Joint Concept for Contested Logistics (JCCL), document outlines the critical need to reduce/eliminate manual decision making within logistics/resupply process that supports the tactical edge.
## RATIONALE :

Demonstrate ability to automatically select DZ/LZ locations for various aerial resupply and insertion based on performance data, environment, terrain, and obstacles.

## PROGRAM OF RECORD :

U.S. Army Airdrop Mission Planning Website USAF Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) Program of Record Net Warrior

## VALUE ADDED/ROI :

- Reduce collateral damage and Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE) risk
- Accelerate emergency resupply with automation
- Situational awareness of potential DZ/LZ locations, reduced time to decision
