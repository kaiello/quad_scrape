## Sustainment Support Network for Autonomous Aerial Resupply Vehicles (SNAARV)

Objectives : Develop a centralized server that sources, processes, synthesizes, and distributes resupply data to field level mission planning systems and resupply vehicles.

## Process:

- Mission planning equipment (maintenance tool)
-  defines the AO based on bandwidth
-  Requests dataset from server
- Server
-  sources and assembles dataset
-  distributes data to mission planning equipment
- Mission planning equipment
-  receives data
-  uses it for preflight mission planning applications
-  Broadcasts data wirelessly to resupply vehicles and verifies receipt
