## Sustainment Support Network for Autonomous Aerial Resupply Vehicles (SNAARV)

PROBLEM/ISSUE :  Current aerial resupply infrastructure lacks the ability to source, process, and distribute flight data to vehicles for mission planning and execution. Data sourcing and distribution rely on a network of highly trained and expensive Field Service Representatives to manually download data on a per mission basis from multiple independent sources, process and synthesis with additional data on a unique mission planning computer and prepared for vehicle transfer. Additionally,  the next generation of guided aerial  resupply vehicles are targeting significantly longer ranges and flight times which will  require much more information prior to and potentially during flight.

## Applicable Guidance/Authority:

- USTRANSCOM FY25 Challenge Ready Now and in the Future - Rapid Distribution Technologies focus area as it autonomously facilitates end-to-end flow of military equipment and cargo.
- USTRANSCOM FY25 Challenge Create Decision Advantage - Big Data focus area given that the infrastructure to be developed will enable data discovery and predictive/prescriptive analytics. List the gaps/challenges/documentation for requirement traceability
- The Joint Concept for Contested Logistics (JCCL) is a Joint Warfighting Concept which is derived from the National Defense Strategy and outlines Resilient Logistics as 'the ability to project and protect access to critical joint logistics material, assets, infrastructure, …, and networks from the point of origin to the point of need…' related to sustainment for distributed operations.

<!-- image -->

RATIONALE: This proposal will leverage existing government owned, disconnected servers and applications to develop an integrated solution that automatically sources, processes, synthesizes, and distributes data to the following autonomous aerial resupply vehicles

PROGRAM OF RECORD: US Army PM FSS JPADS 2klb Program of Record with strong linkages are to the USAF CAT Program of Record and the Special Operations Mission Planning and Execution for integration with currently available systems.

VALUE ADDED/ROI: Provide a streamlined, automated pipeline of mission critical data enabling faster response times to real-time logistics needs, reducing timeconsuming manual decision making and processes.

## Automatic Landing Zone (Auto-LZ)

## PROBLEM/ISSUE :

Future Contested Logistics battlefields will require a various resupply vehicles and domains to counter the adversary's dynamic and evolving threats.  The availability and access to various resupply vehicles places an impossible training burden on the force, since no single person/office will be sufficiently trained on the performance specifications of each air vehicle and be capable to selecting the appropriate Landing Zone (LZ) or Drop Zone (DZ).

Automatic Landing Zone (Auto-LZ)

will aid in the selection of a LZ or DZ by presenting the user with a map-based course of action decision tool, at the point of need. The tool will identify and highlight potential LZs/DZs for use, given the performance specifications, limitations, and the flight model of the air vehicle.

## Applicable Guidance/Authority :

- Addresses the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) Joint Deployment &amp; Distribution Enterprise (JDDE) Challenges Create Decision Advantage Risk Assessment and Ready Now and in the Future - Delivery Technologies through automation of LZ/DZ selection and risk assessment, enablement of automatic emergency landing, and supporting of mission planning.
- Capability Development Document (CDD) for Autonomous Aerial Distribution, 30 April 2020, documents required system attributes for autonomous resupply vehicles of the future. This document includes Key System Attributes (KSA) such as Emergency Landing capability while in route  and the ability to conduct autonomous landing in a cleared area.
- Joint Concept for Contested Logistics (JCCL), document outlines the critical need to reduce/eliminate manual decision making within logistics/resupply process that supports the tactical edge.

## RATIONALE :

Demonstrate ability to automatically select DZ/LZ locations for various aerial resupply and insertion based on performance data, environment, terrain, and obstacles.

## PROGRAM OF RECORD :

U.S. Army Airdrop Mission Planning Website USAF Consolidated Airdrop Tool (CAT) Program of Record Net Warrior

## VALUE ADDED/ROI :

- Reduce collateral damage and Airdrop Damage Estimate (ADE) risk
- Accelerate emergency resupply with automation
- Situational awareness of potential DZ/LZ locations, reduced time to decision

## Small Unit Resupply Decision Dominance (SUR-DD)

PROBLEM/ISSUE: The joint services currently lack the ability to support and manage largescale, high pace distributed operations in the Contested Logistics (CL) environment, where logistics systems and support personnel will need to be flexible and highly adaptive to a mobile and dynamic battlefield. Additionally, Soldiers on the future battlefield will have access to a variety of resupply vehicles to choose from, which presents an impossible training burden to the force; since no single person/decision maker can be sufficiently trained on the performance of all resupply vehicles to determine which vehicle is best suited for a given mission. To overcome these challenges, commanders require an integrated and automated resupply planning and execution system that streamlines and accelerates the responsiveness of emergency aerial resupply by minimizing human in the loop decision making.
